#### Special thanks

- "iOS Forensics: VMP4 File format" by Jesse Spangenberger (<a href="https://digitalforensics.io/ios-forensics-vmp4-file-format/">Blog post</a>)

#### Notes

- `cargo` requires a rust installation.
- Most of this inferred from the decompilation by Ghidra
  of the private framework GeoServices.framework extracted
  from the arm64e dyld cache of MacOS 12.3 (21E230).
